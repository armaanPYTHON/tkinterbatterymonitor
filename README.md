# tkinterbatterymonitor
This project is to make a monitor that lets me know when i have to charge or remove charge from my computer so it doesn't die.


we have used the Python tkinter module, as it is very easy.
After creating the exe file from the code using pyinstaller, I open it everyday in the morning and it keeps a track of the time in the background.

If the battery reaches below 30%, it starts giving warning pop-ups asking me to charge the laptop.
If the battery reaches 100%, it again shows pop-ups, this time asking to remove the charger so I don't overcharge the device
